Hey, my name is Oliver Cole, and I am a Cyber Security BSc student at De Montfort University in the UK. Ideally, I would like to pursue cyber security / information security as a career after university as securing and defending systems is very interesting to me. Aside from cyber security, I have an interest in hardware development, C# and C++ software development and AI / machine learning. 

Please visit <b>olivercole.net</b> to find out more about me or email <b>contact@olivercole.net</b> to get in-touch :)
